Here's a sample `README.md` file for the **Sudoku Solver** project:

# Sudoku Solver

## Overview

This project implements a **Sudoku Solver** in Java that uses the **backtracking algorithm** to solve a 9x9 Sudoku puzzle. The program accepts an unsolved Sudoku grid from the user as input, where the empty cells are represented by `0`. Once the input is provided, the algorithm attempts to solve the puzzle and displays the solved Sudoku grid.

## Features

- **User Input**: The user can input the Sudoku puzzle grid row by row. Empty cells are represented by `0`.
- **Backtracking Algorithm**: The solver uses a backtracking approach to fill the Sudoku grid by trying possible values in empty cells and backtracking if necessary.
- **Grid Display**: The program prints the Sudoku grid in a user-friendly format both before and after solving.

## How to Run the Program

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed (version 8 or higher).
- A terminal or IDE to run the program.

### Running the Program

1. Clone or download the source code to your local machine.
2. Compile and run the program using a terminal or your preferred IDE.

For example, to compile and run using the terminal:

```bash
javac SudokuSolver.java
java SudokuSolver
```

3. The program will prompt you to enter the Sudoku puzzle. Enter the puzzle row by row, separating the numbers by spaces. Use `0` to represent empty cells.

### Example Input

```text
Enter the Sudoku puzzle (use 0 for empty cells):
7 0 2 0 5 0 6 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0
1 0 0 0 0 9 5 0 0
8 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 9 0 1 0 0 0
0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 7
0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 8
0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 9 0 0 0 0 6 3
```

### Example Output

```text
Sudoku solved successfully!

```

## How the Algorithm Works

The Sudoku solver uses a **backtracking** algorithm to solve the puzzle:
1. It searches for an empty cell (represented by `0`).
2. For each empty cell, it tries inserting digits from `1` to `9`.
3. It checks whether placing the digit is valid by ensuring the number does not violate Sudoku rules (i.e., the number cannot already exist in the same row, column, or 3x3 subgrid).
4. If a valid placement is found, it proceeds to the next empty cell.
5. If no valid placement is found, it backtracks and tries a different number in the previous cell.
6. The process continues until all cells are filled correctly, and the puzzle is solved.

## Files

- **SudokuSolver.java**: The main Java file containing the Sudoku solver logic.

## Future Enhancements

- Add functionality to read puzzles from a file.
- Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) for more user-friendly interaction.
- Extend the solver to support puzzles of different sizes (e.g., 4x4 or 16x16 grids).
